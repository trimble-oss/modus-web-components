# Modus Web Components

## Why Build Modus as a Web Component Library?

Modus is a shared source of truth–a place to reference official Trimble patterns and styles. It includes foundational guidelines and components. Web components serve developers by providing ready, framework-agnostic code that helps build better products faster.

Even with this great system, implementing Modus in a large application requires significant effort. Teams typically implement Modus with one-off solutions that end up coupled to a specific framework and siloed within their business unit.

The Modus Web Components library allows web development teams to leverage consistent, battle-tested components across their applications. Contributions made to the Modus Web Components library benefit all participants. Individual teams retain the ability to choose the frameworks and tools that work best for them. Everyone wins!

## Benefits

- **Consistency** - Applications contribute to and share a library of reusable components.
- **Time & Cost Savings** - Developers can stop wasting time coding Modus elements from scratch.
- **Fewer Bugs** - Greater adoption and utilization surfaces bugs faster while improvements and fixes benefit all participants.
- **Quality** - High code coverage and a growing group of collaborators adding their sharp eyes keeps the components stable and reliable.
- **Open Source** - Encourages contribution and ownership across all of Trimble.
- **Framework Agnostic** - Web components run in any browser, regardless of what framework you're using.
- **Better Accessibility** - Consistent accessibility enables differently-abled users to have a great experience.
- **Versioning** - Only update to a newer version when it's convenient for your team.
- **Convenience** - The library is hosted in a centralized package registry, making it easy to install and stay up to date.

## About This Site

Each component has a Docs page which contains component documentation - how to use the component, its properties, methods, DOM events, and accessibility. Some components also contain a Canvas page that provide a playground to take it for a spin. The Canvas' Controls tab allows you to change the inputs for the components, and see a live re-render! The Canvas' Actions tab displays the component's output DOM events (and the event details) after you interact with it.
