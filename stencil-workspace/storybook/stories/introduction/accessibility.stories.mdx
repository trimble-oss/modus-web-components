# Accessibility

The Modus Web Components package is designed to be accessible by default. This means that the components are built with accessibility in mind and are tested to ensure they meet the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

Features:

- Meet [minimum contrast requirements (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html).
- Keyboard navigable where applicable.
- Screen reader accessible.
- Optimized and tested to work with [Windows High Contrast themes](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/09/17/styling-for-windows-high-contrast-with-new-standards-for-forced-colors/).
- Supports the [prefers-reduced-motion media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion) to minimize the amount of non-essential motion.
