# Getting Started

Under Construction - Follow the steps under 'Getting Started' of this [git repo](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components-portal#readme) until official public release. Once released install will be as simple as adding a reference to your package.json file.

Stencil provides documentation on popular [framework integrations](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview).

Recommended - Abstract away from 3rd party libraries. Consider wrapping each Modus Web Component in a component native to your application.
