# Modus Web Components

## Why Build Modus as a Web Component Library?
Modus is a fantastic design system. It provides a pre-defined library of colors, typography, icons, rules, and more.

Even with this great system, implementing Modus in a large application requires an extremely large effort. Currently teams build one off solutions to enable Modus for their organizations. These solutions are framework specific and usually only available to that org.

## Benefits
- **Consistency** - All products implement a library of reusable components.
- **Time & Cost Savings** - Stop spending dev time coding Modus elements from scratch.
- **Fewer Bugs** - A highly utilized system surfaces bugs faster and will receive fixes available to all.
- **Quality** - Components are 100% code covered by unit and e2e tests.
- **Open Source** - Encourages contribution and ownership across all of Trimble.
- **Framework Agnostic** - Web components run in any site, regardless of what framework you're using.
- **Better Accessibility** - Often forgotten or incorrectly applied, helps users with disabilities access our products.
- **Versioning** - Only update to a newer version when it's convenient for your team.
- **Convenience** - The library is hosted in a centralized package registry, making it easy to install and stay up to date.

## Getting Started
Under Construction - Follow the steps under 'Getting Started' of this [git repo](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components-portal#readme) until official public release. Once released install will be as simple as adding a reference to your package.json file.

Stencil provides documentation on popular [framework integrations](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview).

Recommended - Abstract away from 3rd party libraries. Consider wrapping each Modus Web Component in a component native to your application.
