# Modus Web Components

## Why Build Modus as a Web Component Library?
Modus is a fantastic design system. It provides a pre-defined library of colors, typography, icons, rules, and more.

Even with this great system, implementing Modus in a large application requires an extremely large effort. Currently teams build one off solutions to enable Modus for their organizations. These solutions are framework specific and usually only available to that org.

## Benefits
- **Consistency** - All products implement a library of reusable components.
- **Time & Cost Savings** - Stop spending dev time coding Modus elements from scratch.
- **Fewer Bugs** - A highly utilized system surfaces bugs faster and will receive fixes available to all.
- **Quality** - Components are 100% code covered by unit and e2e tests.
- **Open Source** - Encourages contribution and ownership across all of Trimble.
- **Framework Agnostic** - Web components run in any site, regardless of what framework you're using.
- **Better Accessibility** - Often forgotten or incorrectly applied, helps users with disabilities access our products.
- **Versioning** - Only update to a newer version when it's convenient for your team.
- **Convenience** - The library is hosted in a centralized package registry, making it easy to install and stay up to date.

## About This Site
Each component has a Docs page which contains component documentation - how to use the component, its properties, methods, DOM events, and accessibility. Some components also contain a Canvas page which provide a playground for interacting with the specific component. The Canvas' Controls tab allows you to change the inputs for the components, and see a live re-render! The Canvas' Actions tab displays the component's output DOM events (and the event details) after you interact with it.
