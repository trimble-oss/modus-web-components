# Modus Web Components

The [Trimble Modus Design System](https://modus.trimble.com/) describes the UX that Trimble wants to provide in its UI across its many applications. The benefits of using Modus include rapid prototyping, development efficiency, and UX consistency.

Modus includes...

- Typography
- Colors
- Rules
- Elements (components)

This library provides Modus Elements as web components. Web components are reusable, encapsulated UI elements that are framework agnostic (can be implemented in any site). The modus-web-components library was built using the latest UX specs from Figma. Releases follow the [semantic versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) spec.
