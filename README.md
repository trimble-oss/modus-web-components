The [Trimble Modus Design System](https://modus.trimble.com/) describes the UX that Trimble wants to provide in its UI across its many applications. The benefits of using Modus include rapid prototyping, development efficiency, and UX consistency.

Modus includes...

- Typography
- Colors
- Rules
- Elements (components)

This library provides Modus Elements as web components. Web components are reusable, encapsulated UI elements that are framework agnostic (can be implemented in any site). The modus-web-components library was built using the latest UX specs from Figma. Releases follow the [semantic versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) spec.

## Getting Started

### Contribution

If this is your first time in the project, run `npm install` to download 3rd party packages.

All web components are located under the src/components directory.

The index.html file provides a place to render components for development and end to end testing.

Global SCSS files are available to provide Modus colors, variables and functions for component styling.

### Implementation

Stencil web component implementation details can be found in their [Framework Integration Docs](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview).

If you need to use form input web components (eg modus-checkbox, modus-text-input, etc) there are many good examples online.
We won't cover them here as they are often very specific to an individual SPA framework.

## Available Scripts

All NPM scripts are run from the root of the project.

`npm install` - Install 3rd party packages

`npm start` - Compile and run the Stencil development site

`npm run build` - Compile the component library

`npm run test` - Run the unit and e2e tests

`npm run test.watch` - Run the unit and e2e tests with auto re-run on changes

`npm run generate` - Start the interactive Stencil component generator

`npm run lint` - Run ESLint to find problems with JS, TS and SCSS code

## Technology

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - A JS linter to help find and fix problems in code.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - A JS testing framework.
- [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) - A toolchain for building reusable, scalable design systems and web components.
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - The most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.
- [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/) - A module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application.
