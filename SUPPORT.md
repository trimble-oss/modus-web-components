# Support

Is something broken? Do you have a feature request? Have a question?
Feel free to [submit a new Issue](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/issues),
or [start a Discussion](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/discussions)
in the [Modus Web Components GitHub repository](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components).

## Submitting Issues

Whether you're contributing directly to the code or have questions/suggestions, submitting an issue through GitHub is needed
for referencing changes. Please submit change items as an Issue.

If the issue's considered a bug, add the 'bug' label to the issue.

Also add a priority level label to the issue. The priority options are low, medium, and high.
If you are unsure of its priority, reach out to one of the developers for their opinion.

## Starting a Discussion

Discussions are a great way to get thoughts and suggestions from the community.
If you have something you think is important but may not require an Issue quite yet,
start a discussion!
